This use case diagram shows how different people interact with a recycling machine system. There are three main users: the Customer, who returns items, receives refunds, and requests receipts; the Operator, who checks daily usage, generates reports, updates deposit values, and resolves technical issues; and the System Admin, who handles system-level tasks like starting, shutting down, and maintaining the machine. Each action is linked to smaller tasks—for example, returning items includes recognizing the item type and recording the transaction, while receiving a refund includes printing a receipt. The diagram also shows optional actions, like triggering an alarm when technical issues occur. Overall, it gives a clear picture of how the system works and what each user is responsible for.
